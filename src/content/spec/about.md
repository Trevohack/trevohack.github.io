# About

## Who am I? 

I'm Trev, a passionate cyber security enthusiast with a deep focus on offensive security and advanced exploitation techniques. I actively participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, primarily on platforms like Hack The Box (HTB) and TryHackMe (THM), where I challenge myself with complex security problems, reverse engineering, and privilege escalation.

As a certified OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional), PNPT (Practical Network Penetration Tester), and eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester), I have honed my skills in penetration testing, network security, and vulnerability assessment. My journey in cyber security doesn't stop thereâ€”I specialize in rootkit research, delving into the intricate world of kernel-level threats, bypassing defenses, and understanding how to protect systems from these stealthy attacks.

Balancing all of this while being a student has been an exciting challenge, but my passion for learning and exploring new areas of cyber security keeps me constantly motivated. Whether it's discovering new techniques, automating tasks, or refining my expertise in exploit development, I'm always on the hunt for the next big challenge.
